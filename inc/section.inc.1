4. Turn It Into a Strategic Advantage

The greatest opportunities with machine learning and artificial intelligence will not only be what you learn about your data, but how you leverage that information to make it even more valuable to your business. This requires leaders to be aware of what data are most valuable and where your organizationâ€™s strengths and weaknesses are, and then figuring out the best way to turn your data into a strategic advantage.

Look for new ways to leverage new technologies to solve your biggest challenges, but also ask yourself what you can do to optimize the way you are making decisions with this data. For example, you might set goals for data ingestion, data cleansing, data aggregation and visibility that keep the data as close to the application as possible. You could also use your data as the basis for business insight, planning, modeling and forecasting that enables you to reduce costs, accelerate delivery of new features and add value to your customers.
